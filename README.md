## About me 👋

Product-driven front-end engineer working remotely.

I previously founded and built **mosya**, a web development learning platform powered by WebAssembly and Service Workers.  
I successfully exited (sold) the service.

Now I am building my next product:

### 🚀 Gitton
An AI-powered Git client for individual developers.  
https://jsers.dev/service/gitton

I love building developer tools that feel simple, fast, and thoughtful.
